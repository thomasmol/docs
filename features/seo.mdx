Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website from search engines like Google or Bing. 
EO targets unpaid traffic (known as "natural" or "organic" results) rather than direct traffic or paid traffic and is a great way to get more visitors to your website.

Launch Leopard makes SEO easy for you by adding some default and common SEO Metatags and an easy way to override them on a per page basis.

## Setting up Metatags for SEO

The meta tags are located in the root `+layout.svelte` file.

Replace the values in the `defaultSEO` object with your own. These tags are used as default values for all pages. 

```html src/routes/+layout.svelte
<script lang="ts">
    // ... other code
    const defaultSEO = {
        title: 'Launch Leopard',
		description: 'A SvelteKit starter template with Supabase',
		keywords: 'svelte, sveltekit, supabase, starter, boilerplate, saas, typescript',
		ogimage: `${$page.url.origin}/images/ogimage.png`
	};
</script>
```

### How to override the default SEO tags on a per page basis
You can override them on a per page basis by adding a `seo` object to the page's `data` object in a `+load.ts`, `+load.server.ts`, `+layout.ts` or `+layout.server.ts` file of that route.

<Info>
    Tags for invididual pages are optional. If you don't need a specific tag, you can leave it out and the page will use the default value you setup in the root `+layout.svelte` file.
</Info>

An example of how to override the default SEO tags on a blog page:

```typescript src/routes/(landing)/blog/+page.server.ts (example)
import { page } from '$app/stores';

export const load = async () => {
	return {
		seo: {
            title: 'Blog',
            description: 'A collection of articles about SvelteKit and Supabase',
            keywords: 'svelte, sveltekit, supabase, starter, template, typescript, blog',
            ogimage: `${$page.url.origin}/images/blog_ogimage.png`
        }
	};
};
```
<Warning>
    The most nested `seo` object will be used. So if you have a `seo` object in your `+layout.ts` file and in your `+page.ts` file, the `seo` object in the `+page.ts` file will be used.
</Warning>

### Set up Sitemap.xml

Add urls of your marketing pages to the `+server.ts` in `src/sitemap.xml` folder and submit it to Google Search Console so Google can index your pages. Same for Bing Search.


// TODO add example and more detail

// TODO These can also be generated automatically at build time, but different setup is needed


## How to setup Favicons
A favicon set is already included in the `static` folder. Replace them with your own.

You can easily generate  set of favicons using [https://favicon.io](https://favicon.io). 

Just upload a png file of your logo and it will generate a set of favicons for you.

Copy the files into the `static` folder and you are good to go (and remove/replace the old ones).
