## Adding users to audience

New users are automatically added to your Loops audience when they sign up.
This is done in `hooks.server.ts`, when the `createUser` event is triggered like so:
```ts hooks.server.ts
export const handle = sequence(
	SvelteKitAuth({
		// ...
		events: {
			createUser: async (message) => {
				await loops.createContact(message.user.email ?? '', { userId: message.user.id });
			}
		},
		// ..
	}),
	authorization
) satisfies Handle;
```
