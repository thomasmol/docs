## Adding users to audience

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Auth.js">
New users are automatically added to your Loops audience when they sign up.
This is done in `hooks.server.ts`, when the `createUser` event is triggered like so:
```ts hooks.server.ts (Auth.js boilerplate)
export const handle = sequence(
	SvelteKitAuth({
		// ...
		events: {
			createUser: async (message) => {
				await loops.createContact(message.user.email ?? '', { userId: message.user.id });
			}
		},
		// ...
	}),
	// ...
) satisfies Handle;
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Supabase">
    Loops is currently working on an integration with Supabase, so watch out for that!

	For now, you can setup up Database Webhooks with Supabase to add users to your Loops audience.

	* Official Supabase Webhooks [guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/webhooks)
	* Or follow [this](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/supabase-to-loops) Trigger.dev guide
	* Or implement your own way of adding users to your Loops audience, like using the AuthStateChanged event
