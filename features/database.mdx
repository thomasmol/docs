Launch Leopard comes with DrizzleORM, a lightweight and blazing fast Typescript ORM.
It supports Postgres, MySQL and SQLite databases.

Check their [docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) for more details on how to use it.

By default, Drizzle is setup with a Postgres database.
The database schema is found in `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts`.

Also see the `drizzle.config.ts` for the drizzle configuration.

## Updating the database schema

<Steps>
    <Step title="Make changes to your schema">
      Just make changes to your schema in `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts`.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate migration files">
        Generate the migration files with
        ```bash
        npm run db:generate
        ```
        Migration files are located in `drizzle/`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run migration">
        Then migrate them to create the tables in your database:
         ```bash
        npm run db:migrate
        ```

        The migration script is also run when building your app in production with `npm run build`.
    </Step>

</Steps>


## Using other database providers

Drizzle can also be setup with a MySQL or SQLite database.

Make the changes in `drizzle.config.ts`, `src/lib/server/database/drizzle.ts`, `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts` and `src/lib/server/database/migrate.ts` files.
Check the [Drizzle docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) for more details.
