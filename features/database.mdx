## Using Supabase
If you are using Supabase as your database, you can skip this section. 

See the official [Supabase Javascript SDK docs](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript) for more details.

Example of using the Supabase SDK in a server endpoint:
```javascript +server.ts
export const GET = (async ({ request, locals }) => {
	const session = await locals.getSession();
	if (!session) {
		throw new Error('Unauthorized');
	}

	// With Supabase SDK
	const user = await locals.supabase
		.from('users')
		.select('*')
		.eq('id', session.user.id)
		.single();

	return new Response(JSON.stringify(user));
}) satisfies RequestHandler;
```

<Info>
    I am working to see if we can use Drizzle ORM and Drizzle Kit with Supabase (especially usefull for db migrations and typesafety). But since Drizzle is still pre 1.0, usage is limited.

## Using Auth.js with Drizzle ORM

Launch Leopard comes with DrizzleORM, a lightweight and blazing fast Typescript ORM.
It supports Postgres, MySQL and SQLite databases.

Check their [docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) for more details on how to use it.

By default, Drizzle is setup with a Postgres database.
The database schema is found in `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts`.

Also see the `drizzle.config.ts` for the drizzle configuration.

## Updating the database schema

<Steps>
    <Step title="Make changes to your schema">
      Just make changes to your schema in `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts`.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate migration files">
        Generate the migration files with
        ```bash
        npm run db:generate
        ```
        Migration files are located in `drizzle/`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Run migration">
        Then migrate them to create the tables in your database:
         ```bash
        npm run db:migrate
        ```

        The migration script is also run when building your app in production with `npm run build`.
    </Step>

</Steps>


## Using other database providers

Drizzle can also be setup with a MySQL or SQLite database.

Make the changes in `drizzle.config.ts`, `src/lib/server/database/drizzle.ts`, `src/lib/server/database/schema.ts` and `src/lib/server/database/migrate.ts` files.
Check the [Drizzle docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview) for more details.
