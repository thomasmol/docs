## Styling
TailwindCSS is installed by default with the typography, DaisyUI and prettier plugins.

### TailwindCSS
* TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework. It is very useful to quickly style your website.
* Check the [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more information.

### DaisyUI
* DaisyUI is a TailwindCSS component library and is very useful to quickly build a website.
* Check the [DaisyUI documentation](https://daisyui.com/docs) for more information.

## Themes (with DaisyUI)
By default, the `light` and `dark` theme of DaisyUI are included.

* You can add themes in `tailwind.config.js`.
* Please check [https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/) on how to add and create custom themes.
* When the `default` theme is selected, the theme will adhere to the system theme (dark or light).

### How it works
DaisyUI 4.0 introduced a new component called `ThemeController` to switch between themes with only CSS. However, using only the built in `ThemeController` component would not persist the selected theme on page reload.

Therefore we added some extra code and created a custom `ThemeController` component that involves saving the theme in a cookie and writable store.

In the root `+layout.svelte` there is a hidden checkbox that is always checked. This checkbox is used to select a theme using the `$themeStore` store.

The `$themeStore` is a writable store that is used to store the current theme. This store in itself won't persist the theme on page reload. 
Check the custom [ThemeController](/components/themecontroller) component on how to do this.

```html +layout.svelte (root)
<script lang="ts">
    // ...

    // Set theme from page data, which gets value from cookie (see root +layout.server.ts)
	$themeStore = $page.data.theme;

    // ...
</script>

<input type="checkbox" name="theme" class="theme-controller hidden" checked value={$themeStore} />
```

On a page load (in the root `+layout.server.ts`), the theme is set based on a cookie with name 'theme' or defaults to `'default'` (system theme).

```ts +layout.server.ts (root)
export const load = async ({ locals: { getSession }, cookies}) => {
	// Get the theme from the cookie, or default to 'default'
	const theme = cookies.get('theme') || 'default';
	return {
		session: await getSession(),
		theme
	};
};
```
