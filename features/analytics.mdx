Analytics is a vital part of any SaaS business. It helps you understand how your customers are using your product, and how you can improve it.

I recommend a privacy friendly analytics tool like [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) or [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com). 
They both have a free trial and are very affordable.

## Setup Analytics

1. Sign up at either [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) or [Simple Analytics](https://www.simpleanalytics.com)
2. Add the tracking code to your `src/app.html` in the `<head>` section
3. Follow any further instructions on the analytics provider to set up your account
