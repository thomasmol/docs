[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev) (previously NextAuth.js) is a authentication library that is framework and runtime agnostic. 

Previously only available for Next.js, Auth.js is now available for all frameworks and runtimes, including SvelteKit.

Check the [Auth.js documentation for SvelteKit](https://authjs.dev/reference/sveltekit) for more information.

<Warning>Note that Auth.js and its adapter and framework API's are pre-1.0. They are likely to change.</Warning>

## Auth Providers
Auth.js implements many auth providers, like email, Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more.
By default, Launch Leopard implements the email provider, but you can add more providers.
