[Auth.js](https://authjs.dev) (previously NextAuth.js) is a authentication library that is framework and runtime agnostic.

Check the [Auth.js documentation for SvelteKit](https://authjs.dev/reference/sveltekit) for more information.

<Warning>
  Note that Auth.js and its adapter and framework API's are pre-1.0. They are
  likely to change.
</Warning>

## Setting up Auth.js

By default Launch Leopard uses the email provider for authentication. Here is how to set it up:

Run `npm run db:generate` and `npm run db:migrate` to create the database migration files and run the migration. 
By default the database schema has all the tables needed for Auth.js.

Then setup a Loops transactional email to send login links to users:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Setup Loops">
        Make sure you have setup Loops (transcactional + marketing email platform), check the docs [here](/features/email).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create new Transactional email">
        Create a new transcactional email in Loops [here](https://app.loops.so/transactional).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add datavariable ">
    Add a datavariable called `verificationUrl` in the email template. That's where the verification url will be added.
    <img height="200" width="auto" src="/images/loopstransactional.png" />

    You can customize and style the email template however you like.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Publish">
      Hit "Next" and publish the email template.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Set the transactional id">
      You should now see a TRANSACTIONAL ID.
      <img height="200" width="auto" src="/images/loopstransid.png" />
      Copy the TRANSACTIONAL ID and set it in `hooks.server.ts` in the `EmailProvder` provider in the body of the `fetch` request.
```ts hooks.server.ts
export const handle = sequence(
	SvelteKitAuth({
		// ...
		providers: [
			EmailProvider({
				sendVerificationRequest: async ({ identifier: email, url }) => {
					const response = await fetch('https://app.loops.so/api/v1/transactional', {
						method: 'POST',
						headers: {
							'Content-Type': 'application/json',
							Authorization: 'Bearer ' + PRIVATE_LOOPS_API_KEY
						},
						body: JSON.stringify({
							transactionalId: "[YOUR TRANSACTIONAL ID]",
							email,
							dataVariables: {
								verificationUrl: url
							}
						})
					});
				}
			})
		]
	}),
	// ...
) satisfies Handle;
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### Other auth providers

Auth.js implements many auth providers, like email, Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and more.

Add the providers to your `hooks.server.ts` and signin pages.

See the [Auth.js docs](https://authjs.dev/guides) for more information how to implement other providers.

## Database Adapters

Auth.js also implements many database adapters, like Drizzle, Supabase, Prisma, and more.

By default, Launch Leopard implements the Drizzle adapter.

See the [database](/features/database) section for more information.
