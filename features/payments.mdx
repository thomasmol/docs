Stripe is used to handle payments, invoicing, customer portals, subscriptions and more.
The standard database schema comes with a `stripeCustomerId` field on the `User` model, so you can easily relate payments and subscriptions to users.

<Note>
    Please, read how Stripe works at <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/docs">stripe.com/docs</a>, to learn about `webhooks`, `checkout_session`, "test mode" and more.

## Setting up Stripe

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Stripe account">
    At [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register){" "}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate payments">
    You'll need to activate payments on your account. You'll need to be
    registered as a business (anywhere on earth), and you'll need to provide
    some details about your business.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Branding, Emails, Customer Portal">
    * In `Settings > Branding` you can set your logo and colors
    * In `Settings > Customer Emails` turn on emails for successful payments and refunds.
    * In `Settings > Customer Portal` turn on the customer portal, (users can manage their subscriptions and payment methods and view invoices here)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add webhooks endpoint">
    In `Developers > Webhooks` add a webhook with the url `https://[YOUR DOMAIN]/api/webhooks/stripe` and select the events you want to receive (see below).
    * **Testing**: enable `test mode` and use the Stripe CLI to enable webhooks on your local machine. Follow their [guide here](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks/create?endpoint_location=local) for more info.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy keys to .env">
    In `Developers > API Keys` copy the keys to your `.env` file. The webhook secret is found in the `Webhooks` section.
    Make sure you use the `test` keys when in `test mode` and the `live` keys when in production.
    ```env .env
    PRIVATE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_1
    PRIVATE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_1
    PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_1
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Webhooks

Webhooks are used to receive events from Stripe, like when a payment is made or a subscription is cancelled.
Some commonly used events are added in the `src/routes/api/webhooks/stripe/+server.ts` file.

```ts src/routes/api/webhooks/stripe/+server.ts
switch (event.type) {
    case 'checkout.session.completed': { // handle new payment (one-time or subscription)
        const checkoutSession = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
    case 'checkout.session.expired': { // handle expired payment
        const checkoutSession = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
    case 'customer.created': { // handle new customer
        const customer = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
    case 'customer.source.expiring': { // handle expiring card, notify user
        const customerCardOrSource = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
    case 'customer.subscription.deleted': { // handle cancelled subscription, revoke access, send winback email
        const subscription = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
    case 'customer.subscription.updated': { // handle subscription changes, revoke access, notify user
        const subscription = event.data.object;
        break;
    }
```
