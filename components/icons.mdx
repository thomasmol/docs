By default a few icons are included, located in `src/lib/ui/icons/`. 

The icons: 
- ArrowTopRightOnSquare (used to indicate an external link)
- Bars3 (used to indicate a menu)
- Check (used to indicate a success)
- ChevronDown (used to indicate a dropdown)
- ChevronUp (used to indicate a dropdown)
- Home (used to indicate a home link)

They are taken from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) and are free to use. 
Other sources for icons:
- [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/)
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/)

You can add new icons in the `src/lib/ui/icons/` folder. 

Just copy the svg code and paste in a new `[icon_name].svelte` file.

## Usage

```html +page.svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import Check from '$lib/ui/icons/Check.svelte';
</script>

<Check/>
```
