This is a simple resuable dropdown component. It comes with standard with styling and a clickOutside directive to dismiss the dropdown when clicked outside of the dropdown.
You can easily change the text of the button and the content of the dropdown.

The component is made using the DaisyUI dropdown component: [https://daisyui.com/components/dropdown](https://daisyui.com/components/dropdown)

Change the `dropdown-bottom` class to `dropdown-top`, `dropdown-left` or `dropdown-right` to change the direction of the dropdown.

Add the class `dropdown-end` to align the dropdown content.

The `clickOutside.ts` script is used to dismiss the dropdown when clicked outside of the dropdown.
