This is the basic structure of the boilerplate:
```
src/
  lib/
    server/
    ui/
      app/
      components/
      icons/
      marketing/
    clickOutside.ts
  routes/
		(app)/
		(auth)/
		(landing)/
		api/
		+layout.svelte
		+layout.ts
		+layout.server.ts
  app.css
  app.d.ts
  app.html
  hooks.server.ts
static/
.env
package.json
svelte.config.js
tsconfig.json
vite.config.ts
```

## Lib `src/lib/` 
The `lib` folder contains all the components and scripts regarding UI components and client SDKs.
### Server `src/lib/server/`
In the `server` folder you'll find client SDKs and scripts to be used in the server side, such as the Drizzle, OpenAI, Loops and Stripe SDks.

<Info>SvelteKit protects any code inside the `server` folder from being exposed to the client.</Info>

In `src/lib/server/database` you'll also find the database schema file and migration scripts.

### UI `src/lib/ui/`
In the `ui` folder you'll find all the UI components used in the project. The `app` folder contains the main components of the app, the `components` folder contains all the components used in the app, the `icons` folder contains all the icons used in the app and the `marketing` folder contains all the components used in the marketing pages.

## Routes `src/routes/`
### App `src/routes/(app)/`
All of the routes that are behind a login wall are inside the `(app)` folder.

### Auth `src/routes/(auth)/`
Auth pages like login are in the `(auth)` folder.

### Landing `src/routes/(landing)/`
Landing pages are in the `(landing)` folder. These are public and always accessible, whether the user is logged in or not. You should optimize these pages for SEO and conversion.

### API `src/routes/api/`

The `api` folder contains all the API endpoints. These are server-side only and are not exposed to the client.

## Hooks `hooks.server.ts`

In the `hooks.server.ts` file you'll find all the hooks used in the project. Auth is mostly handled here, as well as redirecting users to the correct pages based on their auth status.

Your app can be deployed anywhere where a SvelteKit app can be deployed.
Just make sure to set the correct adapter in `svelte.config.js`.

Follow this guide on Svelte adapters to learn more: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters

I host my apps on [Railway](https://railway.app) with the Node adapter, very simple to setup and you can also host your SQL database there.

Other options include:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Render](https://render.com)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
- [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)

## Environment variables

You need to set the following environment variables in your deployment environment:

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env Auth.js
PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-url
ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
PRIVATE_LOOPS_API_KEY=key
PRIVATE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_1
PRIVATE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_1
PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_1
PRIVATE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_test_1
AUTH_SECRET=1234567890
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
```

```bash .env Supabase
PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-url
ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
PRIVATE_LOOPS_API_KEY=key
PRIVATE_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_1
PRIVATE_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_1
PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_1
PRIVATE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk_test_1
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_KEY"
```
