Your app can be deployed anywhere where a SvelteKit app can be deployed. 
Just make sure to set the correct adapter in `svelte.config.js`.

Follow this guide on Svelte adapters to learn more: https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters

Also make sure to set the environment variables in your deployment environment.

I host my apps on [Railway](https://railway.app) with the Node adapter, very simple to setup and you can also host your SQL database there.
