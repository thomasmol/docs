This is the basic structure of the boilerplate:
```
src/
  lib/
    server/
    ui/
      app/
      components/
      icons/
      marketing/
    clickOutside.ts
  routes/
		(app)/
		(auth)/
		(landing)/
		api/
		+layout.svelte
		+layout.ts
		+layout.server.ts
  app.css
  app.d.ts
  app.html
  hooks.server.ts
static/
.env
package.json
svelte.config.js
tsconfig.json
vite.config.ts
```

## Lib `src/lib/` 
The `lib` folder contains all the components and scripts regarding UI components and client SDKs.
### Server `src/lib/server/`
In the `server` folder you'll find client SDKs and scripts to be used in the server side, such as the Drizzle, OpenAI, Loops and Stripe SDks.

<Info>SvelteKit protects any code inside the `server` folder from being exposed to the client.</Info>

In `src/lib/server/database` you'll also find the database schema file and migration scripts.

### UI `src/lib/ui/`
In the `ui` folder you'll find all the UI components used in the project. The `app` folder contains the main components of the app, the `components` folder contains all the components used in the app, the `icons` folder contains all the icons used in the app and the `marketing` folder contains all the components used in the marketing pages.

## Routes `src/routes/`
### App `src/routes/(app)/`
All of the routes that are behind a login wall are inside the `(app)` folder.

### Auth `src/routes/(auth)/`
Auth pages like login are in the `(auth)` folder.

### Landing `src/routes/(landing)/`
Landing pages are in the `(landing)` folder. These are public and always accessible, whether the user is logged in or not. You should optimize these pages for SEO and conversion.

### API `src/routes/api/`

The `api` folder contains all the API endpoints. These are server-side only and are not exposed to the client.

## Hooks `hooks.server.ts`

In the `hooks.server.ts` file you'll find all the hooks used in the project. Auth is mostly handled here, as well as redirecting users to the correct pages based on their auth status.
